Summary     : System and process monitoring utilities
Description : |
  The procps package contains a set of system utilities that provide
  system information. Procps includes ps, free, skill, pkill, pgrep,
  snice, tload, top, uptime, vmstat, w, watch and pwdx. The ps command
  displays a snapshot of running processes. The top command provides
  a repetitive update of the statuses of running processes. The free
  command displays the amounts of free and used memory on your
  system. The skill command sends a terminate command (or another
  specified signal) to a specified set of processes. The snice
  command is used to change the scheduling priority of specified
  processes. The tload command prints a graph of the current system
  load average to a specified tty. The uptime command displays the
  current time, how long the system has been running, how many users
  are logged on, and system load averages for the past one, five,
  and fifteen minutes. The w command displays a list of the users
  who are currently logged on and what they are running. The watch
  program watches a running program. The vmstat command displays
  virtual memory statistics about processes, memory, paging, block
  I/O, traps, and CPU activity. The pwdx command reports the current
  working directory of a process or processes.
